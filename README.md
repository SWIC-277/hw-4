# HW 4

In [app/index.test.js](app/index.test.js) you will find a series of tests that are failing. Your job is to make them pass. You will need to edit [app/index.js](app/index.js) to make the tests pass.

**DO NOT** edit the tests in [app/index.test.js](app/index.test.js). Rather, in [app/index.js](app/index.js) you will remove the `throw new Error('Not Implemented')` line and replace it with your own code. You should not make any other changes to the file aside from working inside the function bodies and the parameters.

Before doing anything else, make sure to run `npm i`. This will install the dependencies for the project.

To run the tests, run `npm test`. This will run the tests in [app/index.test.js](app/index.test.js) and report the results.

It will run in 'watch' mode so that as you make changes to [app/index.js](app/index.js) the tests will re-run.
